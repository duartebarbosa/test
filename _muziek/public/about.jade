              | A group of young musicians goes to a school together with a music teacher who presents the concert.
              | The musicians play different classical pieces and the teacher explains in between the pieces about the instruments, composers and music theory in general.
              | There is an interactive point in our concert-workshops.
              | The teacher asks questions to the children and the children ask questions to the teacher.
              | In this way children listen to a live classical concert,  learn about music and get interested in classical music.
