                | The Project ''Classical Music is Fun!'â€™ aims to organize educational classical concerts for schools essentially a ''musical day'' where a group of musicians  with a different instruments (e.g. violin, cello, piano, guitar and flute) spends the time with children, gives a concert, explains about the instruments, sings together and makes educational music games. In all of these concert-sessions we are going to have a narrator who will create the verbal and visual interaction with the live music.
                | It is an opportunity for the children to present in a live concert, learn more about music and arouse interest in classical music,
                | At the end of the concert the children will also have an opportunity to play the different musical instruments.
                | In this way they can see, listen and touch the music, become a part of all project and rise an interest to musical instrument.
